# HK SmartFactory - WBS Activity Management Sheet

## Project Overview

Welcome to the HK SmartFactory Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Activity Management System. This repository contains comprehensive project management tools for tracking and managing the HK SmartFactory implementation project.

## What is This?

The HK SmartFactory project aims to modernize factory operations through:
- **Smart Sensors**: Real-time monitoring using dsPIC33EV128 microcontroller
- **Data Analytics**: Advanced data processing and visualization
- **Automation**: Automated workflow management
- **Integration**: Seamless system integration across factory operations

## Repository Contents
